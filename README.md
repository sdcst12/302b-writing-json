## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment 302b Javascript Object Notation (JSON)

Objectives:
* Encode a list or dictionary as a json object
* Decode a json object
* Store more complex data in a JSON encoded format

Once we are able to encode and decode json, it makes sense to be able store data offline. Today we will make use of the json.dumps command to store data into a text file

Your data will be read by your teacher to make sure that it is encoded properly.

Task01 (this is a big one)
You will be creating a user interface and a schema for storing assignment data for a teacher.  You will need to decide the best way of using lists and dictionaries to keep track of your data, and then you will store the data in json encoded format to a file.

Create appropriate functions to separate main blocks into separate modules.
